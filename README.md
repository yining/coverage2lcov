# README

## What

A simple cli tool to generate `lcov` data from data file generated by [coveragepy](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy ), when an older version(`< 6.3`) of which does not have `coverage lcov` command to output coverage data in `lcov` format.

> **Note**
> The output in the generated `lcov` format is very limited: only `DA` record of uncovered lines in source files.

## Why

This started as a solution to a very specific problem in one of my workflows. It's very likely you do not need this tool.

## How

```bash
coverage2lcov .coverage > lcov.info
```

## Install

```bash
cargo install coverage2lcov
```

or from git repository:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/yining/coverage2lcov
```
